# Pomodoro-Clock-2021
A Pomodoro Clock created for FreeCodeCamp's Front End Libraries curriculum.

I built this Pomodoro Clock for Free Code Camp but didn't complete the build their way. The clock does work, but probably won't pass the FCC project tests.

You can see my clock live here: https://albee-jay.github.io/Pomodoro-Clock-2021/ and of course see the code here on GitHub.

I welcome and appreciate any and all comments or help to make this project better. Thank You, Albee-Jay.
